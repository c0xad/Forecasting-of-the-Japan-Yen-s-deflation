This code is for performing time series forecasting on the Japan Yen deflation dataset. 
It uses a combination of machine learning models such as LSTM, ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, and Random Forest to make predictions. 
The code includes data preprocessing steps, model building, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and ensemble forecasting. 
It also uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the predictions made by the models. 
Overall, this code provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and forecasting time series data.
